Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.

For example s=mom, the list of all anagrammatic pairs is [m, m], [mo, om] at positions [[0],[2]], [[0,1],[0,2]] respectively.

Function Description
Complete the function sherlockAndAnagrams in the editor below. It must return an integer that represents the number of anagrammatic pairs of substrings in s.

sherlockAndAnagrams has the following parameter(s):
s: a string.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer q, the number of queries.
Each of the next q lines contains a string s to analyze.

Constraints
1 <= q <= 10
2 <= |q| <= 100

String s contains only lowercase letters âˆŠ ascii[a-z].

Output Format
For each query, return the number of unordered anagrammatic pairs.

Sample Input 0
2
abba
abcd

Sample Output 0
4
0

Explanation 0
The list of all anagrammatic pairs is [a, a], [ab, ba], [b, b] and [abb, bba] at positions [[0], [3]], [[0, 1], [2, 3]], [[1], [2]] and [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]] respectively.

No anagrammatic pairs exist in the second query as no character repeats.

Sample Input 1
2
ifailuhkqq
kkkk

Sample Output 1
3
10

Explanation 1
For the first query, we have anagram pairs [i, i], [q, q], and [ifa, fai] at positions [[0], [3]], [[8], [9]] and [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]] respectively.

For the second query:
There are 6 anagrams of the form [k, k] at positions [[0], [1]], [[0], [2]], [[0], [3]], [[1], [2]], [[1], [3]] and [[2], [3]].
There are 3 anagrams of the form [kk, kk] at positions [[0, 1], [1, 2]], [[0, 1], [2, 3]] and [[1, 2], [2, 3]].
There is 1 anagram of the form [kkk, kkk] at position [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]].

Sample Input 2
1
cdcd

Sample Output 2
5

Explanation 2
There are two anagrammatic pairs of length 1: [c, c] and [d, d].
There are three anagrammatic pairs of length 2: [cd, dc], [cd, cd], [dc, cd] at positions [[0, 1], [1, 2]], [[0, 1], [2, 3]], [[1, 2], [2, 3]] respectively.
