https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/count-triplets-1

You are given an array and you need to find number of triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression) for a given common ratio r and i < j < k.

For example, arr=[1, 4, 16, 64]. If r=4, we have [1, 4, 16] and [4, 16, 64] at indices (0, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 3).

Function Description
Complete the countTriplets function in the editor below. It should return the number of triplets forming a geometric progression for a given r as an integer.

countTriplets has the following parameter(s):
arr: an array of integers
r: an integer, the common ratio

Input Format
The first line contains two space-separated integers n and r, the size of rr and the common ratio.
The next line contains n space-separated integers arr[i].

Constraints
1 <= n <= 0^5
1 <= r <= 10^9
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

Output Format
Return the count of triplets that form a geometric progression.
